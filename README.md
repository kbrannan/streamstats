## `streamstats`: An R package for using the USGS Streamstats API

See API documentation over [here](http://streamstatsags.cr.usgs.gov/streamstatsservices/#)

Currently only has basic functionality for extracting, working with watersheds. May be developed beyond this in the future. Collaborators welcome!
